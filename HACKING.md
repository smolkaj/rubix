# Development
On macOS, I use a virtual enviroment.

Create a new virtual environment:
```
pypython3 -m venv rubix_env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```
pysource rubix_env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies in the virtual environment:
```
pypip install numpy
```

Run script:
```
python rubix_gui.py
```

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```
